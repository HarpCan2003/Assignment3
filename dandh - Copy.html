            <p>
                The ocean spawners that are most prevalent in southern US seas include the Atlantic round herring (Etrumeus sadina), Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), 
                and Pacific sardine or pilchard (Sardinops sagax). On the Atlantic coast, anadromous fish, such as alewife or glut herring (Alosa pseudoharengus), American shad 
                (A. sapidissima), and blueback herring (A. aestivalis), live in the sea but reproduce in fresh water. Nonetheless, alewife and American shad are quite prevalent
                in Canadian coastal waters, where they are harvested for profit, even if they are also most plentiful there.
