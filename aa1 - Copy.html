                The Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is a species of herring found in the Pacific Ocean near North America and northeast Asia.
                The top of the rear of the herring's body is bluish-green, while the sides and stomach are a brilliant silver colour. Pacific herring 
                has a countershaded colour that makes it more difficult to see from above or below.
