        <h2>Apperance</h2>
        <p> The top of the rear of the herring's body is bluish-green, while the sides and stomach are a brilliant silver colour. Pacific herring 
            has a countershaded colour that makes it more difficult to see from above or below. The herring uses countershading to conceal itself from a variety 
            of possible predators, such as bigger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. 1 The eyes of the pacific herring are another distinguishing characteristic; 
            they are relatively large for a species of its size.

        <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
        <p>
            Individuals of this species can survive up to twenty years in the chilly waters of the Bering sea, though lifespans vary depending on environment.
            For spawning, herring move to nearby brackish waters. The males fertilise the females' eggs when they lay them on seaweed and seagrass beds. These protected environments 
            are where herring larvae spawn. They migrate back to the ocean for two to three years once they reach the juvenile stage before they achieve maturity and come ashore to reproduce.
